What were some challenges you faced while making this app?
* Qinghang:
The biggest challenge is the heroku part. I try many times to upload my file. And also some of the logical coding. Because my background is in Java, I always feels not-comfortable by coding with dynamic data Type language. 
* Quan Gao:
The biggest challenge for me is to familiar with react and redux. Since I have no experience in javascript before, I had a hard time to learn how to use different components of react, and pass data between them. 

Given more time, what additional features, functional or design changes would you make
* Qinghang:
If you give me more time, I will try more about styling things. Because I lack styling practice, It is hard for me to do the styling and I just push all the styling pressure to my teammate. 
* Quan Gao:
Right now, the only thing AI can do is picking a coordinates randomly. If I have more time I will make the game more challenge. For example, once AI hit one of player's ship, it will try to hit coordinates around that ship until all the parts are destroyed.

What assumptions did you make while working on this assignment?
* Qinghang:
I have tried many different assumptions, like in the AI, tey many different assumptions to make it work.
* Quan Gao:
My assumptions are users are only going to play battleship game with random placed ships, users can not arrange their ship manually. And users will follow the rules from the rulebook.
How long did this assignment take to complete?
* Qinghang:
This assignment almost took me like 10 to 12 hours for my part.
* Quan Gao:
About 5-7 hours on my part.
